# Method
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and Australia. 
One in every four deaths in the U.S. occurs as a result of heart disease. In this study, we will apply at least five different machine learning algorithms to cover
what I learn so far for regressison/classification. From now, we have learned linear, logistic, polynomial regression with proper variable selection, linear or quadratic discriminant analysis, 
K-nearest neighbor classifier, jackknife, bootstrap, ridge regression, lasso, principal components regression, partial least squares, splines, regression and classification trees, support vector machines, 
clustering, and related methods. 

Moreover, we will apply cross-validation techniques to find the optimal degree of flexibility â€“ the best subset of predictors or the optimal tuning parameters. Evaluate prediction performance of competing methods. 
Illustrate results with appropriate plots and diagrams.
